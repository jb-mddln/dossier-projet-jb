The Bad's Club, located in Lyon's 7th arrondissement near the Jean Macé metro station, is a 1500 m² sports and lounge facility that offers various racket sports courts for both beginners and intermediate players. The club plans to develop a website and mobile app to optimize the reservation process and assist members in finding suitable playing partners, which will enhance user engagement and client retention.

The primary goals include creating a user-friendly reservation system and improving reservation management to increase court occupancy and revenue. By providing a seamless user experience on digital platforms, the club aims to retain current members and attract new ones through features like partner finding. Advanced matching algorithms will consider individual preferences and skill levels to suggest appropriate partners. This strategy focuses on boosting member engagement, attracting new clients, and setting the club apart from competitors.
